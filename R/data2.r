#' Simulated data.
#'
#' The data were simulated with a gsc model with two
#' exogeneous and one endogeneous compostes. Each composite has three indicators.
#' All have loadings. There are 50 observations.

#' @format A data frame with 9 variables and 50 cases:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{V1,V2,V3}{Indicators of first exogeneous composite} 
#'   \item{V4,V5,V6}{Indicators of second exogeneous composite}
#'   \item{V7,V8,V9}{Indicators of endogeneous composite} 
#' }
